## **Protein Scructure Prediction w/ Computational Model**
With the rise in neural networks being used in predicting how proteins will fold, this model attempts to recreate top models such as AlphaFold with lower complexity. 

### Background
AlphaFold2 is a multicomponent artificial intelligence system that uses machine learning to predict a proteinâ€™s 3D structure based on its amino acid sequence. AlphaFold, which was created by DeepMind, is trained on known protein structures and their amino acid sequences from the Protein Data Bank. It uses these known sequences to find relationships and predict how a new protein will fold. AlphaFold also incorporates attention mechanisms to model spatial relationships and refine predictions. Other models, such as RoseTTAFold, use similar techniques to simulate folding. These tools have been very impactful in the bioinformatics field by providing accurate predictions, which aids in drug discovery and disease research.

For my research project, I aim to recreate AlphaFold by creating a model that predicts how a protein will fold based on its amino acid structure. Along with this, I will do a deep dive into how AlphaFold works and create a presentation on its functionality. I am drawn to this project because it is something that I did in the past and hope to finish with this project. I am interested in machine learning, and this project is the perfect intersection between my interests and the content of the class. I hope to gain a greater understanding in how neural networks function and learn more about bioinformatics.
